## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C) to evoke nature and health. Derived from the association of plants with nature and health. Given that this is an app for detecting diseased plants, we will use a light scheme.
- Background color: Very light green (#F1F8F0) to provide a clean, natural backdrop that doesn't distract from the plant images or analysis results.
- Accent color: Earthy yellow (#A1887F) to highlight important interactive elements, buttons, and actionable insights, differing in both saturation and brightness.
- Clean, sans-serif font for clear and easy-to-read display of diagnostic information.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different plant diseases and recommended actions.
- A clean, minimalist layout to ensure the app is easy to navigate and the results are easy to understand.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during image analysis and navigation.
